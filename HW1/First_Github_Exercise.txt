* Bill Gates or Gary Kidall? Thomas Edison or Nicola Tesla? Rosalind Franklin or Watson and Crick? Steve(Jobs or Wozniak)?

Answer: Kildall, Tesla, Franklin!!!, Wozniak. The true masterminds behind great science and technology who often get overshadowed
because someone else was better at 'patenting ideas' rather than the actual work. 

* How might modern data science be disruptive to your industry? 

Answer: In my industry specifically, the tech industry, many companies manipulate data science as a way to make a profit rather
than being concerned with things like privacy or transparency. They are data-driven, altering their motives to help them 
stay on top, while I intead admire companies that are data-influenced. They use data to help innovate but still respect boundaries.
